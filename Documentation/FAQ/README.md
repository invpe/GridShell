# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

1. What is GridShell?

   GridShell is a collaborative distributed computing system (POC/MVP) designed to utilize the idle processing power of underutilized IoT devices.
   It creates a network where these devices can contribute to computational tasks, storage, and serverless capabilities.

2. How does GridShell work?

   GridShell works by connecting IoT devices, such as ESP32 sensors, into a network. Users submit computational tasks to the network,
   which are then executed across these devices, harnessing their combined processing power. Telemetry data is stored and replicated across nodes,
   and a validation mechanism ensures task accuracy and reliability.

3. What are Shell Tokens?

   Shell Tokens are GridShell's native reward system. Users earn Shell Tokens by successfully executing tasks for others within the GridShell network.
   These tokens can be redeemed for accessing distributed computing power, redeeming telemetry storage slots, and incentivizing participation within the ecosystem.


4. How can I earn Shell Tokens?
   
   You can earn Shell Tokens by successfully completing tasks within the GridShell network. Each validated task completion rewards you with Shell Tokens.

5. What are the applications of GridShell?

   GridShell has diverse applications including educational projects, IoT sensor networks, collaborative data analysis, visualization, offloading tasks,
   custom processing, and much more.

6. Can GridShell work with other IoT platforms?

   Yes, GridShell is designed with extensibility in mind and can seamlessly integrate with other platforms like Raspberry Pi.
   The project is open source and it can be adapted to various hardware environments, opening up a broader range of use cases and possibilities.

7. How does GridShell contribute to a sustainable future?

   GridShell reduces waste by utilizing the idle processing power of underutilized IoT devices, contributing to a greener,
   more interconnected future. It also empowers users to make the most of their IoT investments and reduce infrastructure expenses.

8. What makes GridShell unique?

   GridShell is unique in its innovative approach to harnessing the idle processing power of IoT devices for distributed computing.
   Unlike traditional systems, GridShell repurposes underutilized devices, such as ESP32 sensors, creating a collaborative network that maximizes their potential.

9. How does GridShell contribute to the future of IoT?
   
   GridShell is positioned at the forefront of the rapidly expanding IoT ecosystem, tapping into the billions of online devices,
   with even more predicted to go online in the coming years. This innovative platform introduces the concept of IoT devices earning real value
   for their owners instead of idling. By unlocking the latent processing power of these devices and creating a marketplace where their
   contributions are rewarded with Shell Tokens, GridShell idea introduces the potential to spark a new market dynamic,
   where every connected device becomes a valuable asset in the distributed computing landscape.

10. What are the supported devices for use?

    Pretty much any ESP32 can become a GridShell node, as long as you can compile the sources or upload the latest release, you're ready to go.

11. Why is this project a POC / MVP ?
    As the sole developer of this project, advancing GridShell beyond its current Proof of Concept (POC) or Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stage demands
    significant time, resources, and networking. Focusing solo, my efforts are concentrated on demonstrating the project's potential through its MVP/POC iteration.
    This allows for a clear showcase of its capabilities while acknowledging that further development into a fully-fledged product requires additional investment and collaboration.

12. Why use a scripting language like MyBasic?

    To prioritize simplicity in implementation and ease of demonstration, I've opted for a scripting language for tasks executed on GridShell. MyBasic's  straightforward syntax ensures accessibility for all users, fostering a welcoming environment for experimentation and testing within the GridShell ecosystem.
