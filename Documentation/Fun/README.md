# ðŸ˜„ Lets make some fun

## Mining DuinoCoin on the GridShell 
I find [DuinoCoin](https://duinocoin.com/) very fun, enabling low power devices in the *mining* world? 
Why not, i like ideas that are fresh and *green* - especially if i can connect them with GridShell.
Once i spend few minutes rolling out a distributed DuinoCoin miner, since this is SHA1 it works with ESP32 out of the box.
Their protocol is simple and allows for a quick integration. Of course, this will never be efficent to run on GridShell 
due to the characteristics of distributed computing, but executing a mining task on the network is a good fun and exercise âœ¨

This isn't anything special, but demonstrates how quickly i could integrate a network of nodes to a specific task.

### Idea

I kept the idea very simple:

- Connect to DUCO pool and obtain the JOB
  
`[DUCO] 14fdda11b02fc91a3a85fec35d7150cc0d24aa5a,d657a8b3018db68a32b270c14b23f0fcdc56e710,8`

- Submit a task to the GRIDSHELL looking for a value that generates a SHA1 matching DUCO
  
`[GS:AddTask] dduco 998ba1adb4c0d632df8cb73bb5c13796fb55bfa8,9478d5ff0122708a90fa3bc06c1f069086933ed3,0,1000,`
    
- Wait for job completion polling the API (task status 3 or 4)
  
`[GSHELL] 81807 State 4 : 324`
  
- Once done, return results to DUCO

```
[DUCO] Sending resulst: 324,100,SolarMiner,GridShell
[DUCO] GOOD
```

I left it working for some time, had free Shells to spend and kept it going.

### Was it really working ?

Yes, see some balance dumps here from the wallet page.

```
5621.810133 DUCO
5621.82252972 DUCO
5621.8245512 DUCO
