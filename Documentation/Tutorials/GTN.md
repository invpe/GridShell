# ðŸ©¹ What is Test Net
The current version of GridShell is under continuous development, with ongoing updates, improvements, bug fixes, and occasional crashes. To enhance its performance, we require a robust testing environment where people can participate, execute tasks, intentionally stress test it, and allow for occasional failures.

Our testing environment, known as the GridShell TestNet or "GTN," is hosted on a VPS server. All nodes connect to it via the address "work.gridshell.net" and use port "1911." Despite being a testing environment, we have invested significant effort to ensure its high availability.

You can monitor the availability status of the Work server by visiting the UptimeRobot dashboard here: [GridShell Work Availability](https://stats.uptimerobot.com/NyDyVSVPD1).
