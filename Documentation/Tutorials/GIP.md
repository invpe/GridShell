# Grid Improvement Proposal
All projects require updates, changes and improvments. GridShell is no different.
Improvements and major changes for GridShell will be stored in files called GIP that everyone can access
 
I know you can do it with the source code, but i also know not everyone understands source codes.
To make it clear to everybody i decided to write dedicated documentation about the changes being implemented.

Since GridShell is available thanks to You sharing computational power voluntarily - all proposals are decided to be publicly available and
open for discussion and suggestions.

GIP document serves as a documentation of a change in the system, hopefully this will serve better than comments in the code ;-)
