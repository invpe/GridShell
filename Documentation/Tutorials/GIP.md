# Grid Improvement Proposal
All projects require updates, changes and improvments. GridShell is no different.
Improvements and major changes for GridShell will be stored in files called GIP that everyone can access.

Since GridShell is available thanks to You sharing computational power voluntarily - all proposals are decided to be publicly available and
open for discussion and suggestions.

GIP document serves as a documentation of a change in the system, once it is approved by the majority of the users it is planned for a release.
GridShell will use a Voting process for decision making about implementing GIP to production.
