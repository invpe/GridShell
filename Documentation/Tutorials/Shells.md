# üêö What are shells ?
Shells are virtual credits that users earn when executing tasks on the network.

# How do i use Shells ?
Shells are required to run a task and write telemetry on the grid - currently `one task = one shell`, meaning for each task submitted you need to have one shell token. 
The more shells you have, the more tasks you can run on the network.

# How do i get Shells ?
When a task is assigned to your node and executed a validation mechanism kicks in, once confirmed that the execution was correct, you get one shell token.

# How can i check how many shells i have ?
The simplest method is to use API server and open your account json file like so: https://api.gridshell.net/user/PocNetGroupMiners00000000000000000000001.json
