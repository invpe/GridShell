# ‚è© Setting up vanilla nodes from a release file
If you're not planning to work with sources, the most convienient way to setup a GS Node is to upload release to the board.

Follow the tutorial below, to program your board and configure the node in few simple steps.

## Download latest merged release file 

- ESP32: Click [https://github.com/invpe/GridShell/releases/latest/download/esp32merged.bin](https://github.com/invpe/GridShell/releases/latest/download/esp32merged.bin) 
- ESP8266: Click [https://github.com/invpe/GridShell/releases/latest/download/esp8266merged.bin](https://github.com/invpe/GridShell/releases/latest/download/esp8266merged.bin) 

and download all in one binary file, which you can simply upload to your esp32 device over WEB (simplest) or command line (advanced).


## Use web flasher - flashing from the web page (Chrome)

The simplest way to upload the vanilla binary is through the web page, see the video below of how i do it, and follow the steps
to get your esp node programmed with the latest vanilla sources.
