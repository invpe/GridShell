# üë®‚Äçü¶≤ JOIN

Joining GridShell is as easy as providing a 64 bytes long string, that is known only to you.

It is easiest to just generate your string with `SHA256` hashing function. 
The string you choose to identify with GridShell should not be exposed, keep it private and secure!

You can simply use the [GridShell PHP command line tool](https://github.com/invpe/GridShell/tree/main/Sources/PHP) or any [web sha256 generator](https://tools.keycdn.com/sha256-online-generator) to get yourself a hash.

Your newly generated user string will undergo a [cooling period](https://github.com/invpe/GridShell/blob/main/Documentation/GIP/0070-V09Accountless.md) for some time.
Meantime see how easy it is to get your first task executed on the network, it only takes 17 lines of code :-)
