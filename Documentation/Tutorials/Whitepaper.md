# GridShell Whitepaper
## Abstract
GridShell is a collaborative distributed computing system designed to harness the idle processing power of underutilized IoT devices. This whitepaper provides an overview of GridShell's architecture, features, and its potential applications in the world of distributed computing.

## Introduction
In today's world, millions of IoT devices, such as ESP32 sensors, are underutilized, idling away their processing capabilities while performing simple tasks. GridShell was born out of the realization that we can do more with these devicesâ€”much more. It envisions a world where these devices come together, forming a dynamic ecosystem that offers distributed computing power, storage, and serverless capabilities.
By harnessing the untapped processing power of idle IoT devices, GridShell not only maximizes the potential of underutilized hardware but also brings substantial advantages to the table. From cost reduction and collaborative data analysis to seamless integration and serverless device creation, GridShell empowers users to make the most of their IoT investments.

## Problem Statement
Many IoT devices are limited by single-use applications or idle for the majority of their lifecycle. This underutilization is wasteful in terms of both computational resources and energy consumption. GridShell addresses this issue by repurposing idle devices for distributed computing tasks, creating a collaborative network that benefits from their collective power.

# Technical Overview
## Architecture
GridShell's architecture is built on a network of IoT devices, including ESP32 sensors, and a central server. Nodes in the network share computational tasks, validate results, and store telemetry data.

## Protocols
Secure data transfer is ensured through the implementation of SSL/TLS protocols, guaranteeing the integrity and confidentiality of data exchanged between nodes and the server.


# Key Features
GridShell offers several key features:

- Distributed Computing: Users can submit computational tasks that are executed across the network, harnessing the combined power of IoT devices.

- Telemetry Storage: Telemetry data, referred to as "chunks," is stored and replicated across nodes, providing collaborative storage capabilities.

- Validation Mechanism: A validation process ensures the accuracy and reliability of task execution, with rewards in the form of Shell Tokens for successful validations.

- Shell Tokens: GridShell's native reward, Shell Tokens, are used within the ecosystem for various purposes, including accessing distributed computing power, redeeming telemetry storage slots, and incentivizing participants.
  - Earning Shell Tokens: Users can earn Shell Tokens by successfully executing tasks for others within the GridShell network. Each validated task completion rewards the user with Shell Tokens.

  - Redeeming Telemetry Storage: Shell Tokens can be redeemed to unlock telemetry storage slots. As users accumulate tokens, they gain the ability to store and manage more telemetry data within the GridShell ecosystem.

  - Incentivizing Participation: Shell Tokens play a pivotal role in incentivizing active participation within GridShell. They encourage users to contribute their processing power, making the network more robust and dynamic.
    
  - Burning Tokens: Every time a user submits a task for execution within the GridShell network, they "burn" a Shell Token. This mechanism ensures that tokens are used as intended, promoting fair and active participation in the ecosystem.
  
- Serverless Device and Application Building: GridShell enables the creation of serverless devices and applications, reducing the need for external hosting services.
- Easy integration: Simple API endpoint allows for quick integration with other applications. The GridShell library can contribute to and use the GridShell network at the same time

# Use Cases
GridShell's applications are diverse:

- Educational Projects: Use the network to teach concepts of distributed computing, sensor networks, and data collection.

- IoT Sensor Networks: IoT devices can contribute to distributed computing tasks while performing their primary sensing functions.
  Imagine a vast air quality operation where IoT sensors continuously collect data on atmospheric pollutants levels. GridShell allows these sensors to not only perform their primary
  functions but also contribute their idle processing power to predictive analytics, reporting and visualization of the data.
  
- Reducing costs: Solution can be used to zero out the cost at the entry stage of your product. No hosting needed, deploy & test with GridShell.
  Startups and entrepreneurs can eliminate hosting costs during the initial stages of product development by leveraging GridShell's serverless capabilities.
  Deploy and test your product without the burden of infrastructure expenses.
  
- Collaborative Data Analysis: Users can pool their computational resources for collaborative data analysis and processing.
  In the field of research, multiple institutions can collaboratively analyze datasets for studies.
  GridShell enables distributed data processing, fostering innovation and breakthroughs through collective computational power.
  
- Visualization: With GridShell's Explorer endpoint, users can effortlessly visualize their telemetry data. Whether you're monitoring environmental conditions or analyzing financial trends,
  a single click provides valuable insights into your data.
  
- Offloading: Reduce load and move it to the network
  Offload tasks from your local device to the GridShell network. This reduces device strain and ensures efficient, uninterrupted operation.
  
- Custom processing: Write scripts and execute them on the network
  Tailor computing tasks to your specific needs.

- Simplify IOT data storage: Submit telemetry to GridShell from all of your nodes then access it via API or visualize with Explorer endpoint.

# Roadmap
