# Update
In March 2024, the Explorer instance was discontinued to enable me to prioritize core development tasks over the maintenance of the public site. Thanks to GridShell's open telemetry system, individuals can now construct their own visualization tools by accessing the system's core telemetry files.

- Read `GRIDSHELLCoreValidators1CURRENT` for latest snapshot in JSON format

- Read `GRIDSHELLCoreValidators1TASKS` for the latest list of tasks and their statuses

# Git Webpage
To get a feeling of how things are doing, a simple Git webpage has been created to display part of the informations from the above telemetry files,
[see](https://invpe.github.io/GridShell/) here!
