# GIP 0032 - Handling Successful Integrity Checks

- Author(s): gridshell
- Date: 11/11/2023

In the scenario where the DFS integrity check is successful, meaning the hash of a chunk on a node matches the hash on the validator, the following actions will be taken:

Standard Task Execution: The task execution process will follow the standard logic without any deviations.

User Validation: The user who submitted the task will receive additional User Performance Factor (UPF) points for contributing to the network's data integrity. 

Reward Allocation: If the task was marked for a reward, the user will be granted one Shell Token as a reward for their contribution to the successful validation of data.
