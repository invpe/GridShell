# Synopsis
Remove the old way the communication was handled, replacing it with TLS connection :

Migrating to TLS from an old custom plain text protocol brings several advantages.

- First, TLS provides robust encryption and authentication, ensuring data privacy and integrity
- Second, TLS offers cross-platform compatibility and industry-standard security, reducing development time and enhancing the reliability of the communication infrastructure. 
- Lastly, TLS simplifies the management of security aspects, allowing to focus on application's core functionality, all while benefiting from established security best practices and standards.
