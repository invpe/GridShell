# GIP 0008 - Protocol V005 Version

- Author(s): gridshell

# Synopsis
Protocol update to version 005

Add EXEC parameter to JOB (ident) to mark node for executing tasks (1) or not (0).


# Rationale
To allow for easier work with GS, disable assigning tasks to nodes that do not want to execute them.
This is helpful in situations where a lot of tasks are being processed, and the user is having hard time
to find himself in lots of commands coming from the server assigning tasks to his id.

Additionaly it allows to create nodes that have constraints and want to leverage other GS functionality (like WRITE) 
without having to execute tasks.

ESP32 examples were updated but also protocol has changed to V005 to reflect this change.
