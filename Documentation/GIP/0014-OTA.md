# GIP 0014 - Vanilla Node OTA

- Author(s): gridshell
- Date: --/-/2023

# Synopsis
The OTA (Over-The-Air) process has been implemented to assist in the seamless maintenance of nodes operating on Vanilla firmware. It accomplishes this by automatically updating the firmware whenever necessary. This not only benefits the volunteers managing these nodes by keeping them current with the latest enhancements and bug fixes but also eliminates the need for physical access to the devices. Furthermore, these updates play a vital role in enhancing the overall network's robustness, ensuring that nodes are consistently on stable releases and receive timely updates, thereby contributing to the network's health.

# How does it work ?
The process of upgrading a Node fires immediately after the node connects to the server.
Since [protocol](https://github.com/invpe/GridShell/tree/main/Documentation/Protocol) is sending version during welcome together with other details, Nodes will compare their version with server version and perform OTA if different. The firmware is downloaded from the latest GitHub release using following link:

> **Warning**<br>
OTA process will `format` the FLASH memory completely, therefore it is not recommended to run user code on Nodes.
