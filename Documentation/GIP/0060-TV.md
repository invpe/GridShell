# GIP 0060 - Implementation of Dynamic Theoretical Value for Utility Tokens
- Author(s): gridshell
- Date: --/--/23


1. Abstract

This improvement proposal outlines a new methodology for dynamically calculating the theoretical value of utility tokens in GridShell. 
The proposed system uses real-time network metrics to adjust the value of tokens, aligning it closely with the current demand and utilization of the network.
2. Introduction

GridShell seeks to enhance the way utility tokens are valued within its ecosystem. 
The traditional static valuation method does not adequately reflect the fluctuating demand and network activity. This proposal introduces a dynamic valuation model to address this issue.
3. Rationale

    The need for a value system that reflects real-time network demand and efficiency.
    Enhancing token utility and incentivizing network participation.
    Aligning token value with the services and resources provided by the network.

4. Proposed Methodology

    **Base Value:** A predefined starting value for tokens.
    **Workload Modifier**: Reflects the average workload per node, calculated as the number of tasks awaiting execution divided by the number of active nodes.
    **Utilization Modifier (UM)**: Represents network utilization, scaled to enhance the impact of high demand.
    **Node Modifier (NM)**: Adjusts the token value based on the number of active nodes, ensuring balance in the token economy.

5. Calculation Formula

```Token Value=Base Value×Workload Modifier×UM×NMToken Value=Base Value×Workload Modifier×UM×NM```

6. Expected Outcomes

    - A more responsive and fair token valuation system.
    - Increased user engagement and network participation.
    - Better alignment of token value with network performance and utility.

7. Impact

    - Users: Will experience a more dynamic and market-responsive token valuation.
    - Network Health: Expected to improve with a more engaged user base.
    - Project Growth: A fair and responsive valuation system can attract more users and contributors.
 
8. Conclusion

This proposal aims to enhance the utility and relevance of tokens within GridShell, 
ensuring that their value accurately reflects the state and demand of the network. The adoption of this dynamic valuation model is expected to lead to a more vibrant and efficient ecosystem.
