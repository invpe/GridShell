# Synopsis
This GIP serves as a foundation for accessing the TestNet operational costs and rewards, denominated in GridShell tokens, which encompass both execution and usage within the network. 
Please note that, given the evolving nature of the project and its current phase, these costs are subject to change. However, this document will be consistently updated to reflect the latest information.

# Rationale
