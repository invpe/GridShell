# GIP 0027 - Introducing GridShell Award System

- Author(s): gridshell
- Date: --/--/2023

# Synopsis
GridShell is taking a step forward in recognizing and rewarding the contributions of our valued users. With the proposed GridShell Award System, we aim to acknowledge and incentivize users who actively participate in the GridShell ecosystem.

# Rationale
Award System will track user activity, including task submissions, successful executions, length of involvement, telemetry desynchs, and more. 
Based on predefined criteria, users will receive Shell Tokens as awards, allowing them to unlock additional benefits within the GridShell network.

The GridShell Award System not only promotes active user engagement but also fosters a sense of community and collaboration. By rewarding contributions,
we empower our users to play a central role in the evolution of the GridShell project.
