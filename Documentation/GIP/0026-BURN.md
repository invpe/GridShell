- Author(s): gridshell

# Synopsis
Enable option to _burn_ shell tokens using a command.
The option to burn shell tokens for telemetry slots provides a practical and meaningful way for users to manage their resources.

This GIP implements the mechanics and enables [GIP0015](https://github.com/invpe/GridShell/blob/main/Documentation/GIP/0015-Shell2Telemetry.md) telemetry slot redemption.



# Details
With the addition of `BURN` command, everyone can redeem Sheel Tokens in a simple way. 
The command will have a cost associated, made of:

- Cost of the _Burn option_ selected
- Cost of adding a _void task_

## Burn options

With this implementation following burn options are added:

- `TSLOT` - which will increase **Telemetry Slot** by **+1**

## Burn costs

- `TSLOT` equals `1000` Shell Tokens
- Void task submission `1` Shell token
