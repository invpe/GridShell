# GIP 0031 - Handling Failed Integrity Checks

- Author(s): gridshell

## Identification of Discrepancy
Regular integrity checks are conducted on chunks stored on nodes.

A discrepancy is identified when the MD5 hash of a chunk on a node differs from the MD5 hash of the same chunk stored on the validator.


## Failed Task and UPF
A failed task is marked for the integrity check, and the node's UPF (User Performance Factor) is reduced.
This is a standard task logic, no changes are introduced.

This UPF penalty reflects the node's failure in maintaining data integrity.

## Automatic Replication
Upon detecting a failed integrity check, the system initiates an automatic replication process for the affected chunk.

## Data Restoration
After successful replication, the discrepancy is resolved, and the chunk is consistent across the network.

## Logging and Monitoring
All integrity check activities, including successes and failures, are logged for reference.

A monitoring system tracks the status of chunks and integrity check results.

## Automated Response
The system automatically responds to integrity failures, ensuring data consistency and reliability.

By following this process, GridShell maintains data integrity, corrects discrepancies, and enhances the overall robustness of the network. 
This approach ensures that data remains reliable, even in the face of potential issues.
