# üßë‚Äçüè≠ üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è TOOLS

In the vast world of GridShell, there's a world of potential tools and applications waiting to be crafted. 
These are some ideas of tools that can make GridShell experience even better.

- A Playground: A place to unleash your creativity, write custom scripts, and test them locally.
- A Mobile App: Convenient access to monitor node performance, view your account details, and stay connected on the go.
- A Script Submission Pipeline: Streamlined submission of new tasks for execution, making it easy to harness the power of the network. 

Developing and maintaining these tools can be time-consuming, and my focus remains on strengthening the core GridShell. 

That's where you come in! I invite the GridShell community to contribute, collaborate, and bring these ideas to life. 
Together, we can make GridShell more accessible, efficient, and user-friendly. 

So, if you're passionate about any of these concepts, don't hesitate to pick them up, develop your solutions, and share them with the world.
Your contributions will help pave the way for an even more vibrant and user-friendly GridShell ecosystem.

All submissions will be rewarded :-)
