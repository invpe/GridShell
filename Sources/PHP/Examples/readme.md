# Simple uses of php lib

Some usefull scripts when deploying your own instance of GridShell

Please be advised these scripts have absolutely minor error checks in place, they serve as an example not a 'ready-to-use-production-tools'
With that in mind, enjoy and have fun tweaking / modifying.

As usual, i encourage you to contribute with better alternatives of my scripting ideas! :)
