# Vanilla nodes for GS

This repository contains the source code for pure vanilla nodes in GridShell. Recently, I have added support for the ESP8266, enabling these boards to join the network as well.

The compilation process will determine the appropriate version to compile, utilizing #ifdef directives to manage this.
