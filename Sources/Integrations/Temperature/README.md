# :ocean: Pool temperature sensor :whale:

Become GridShell computing volunteer while swimming in your pool like a :fish:.
When diving or taking a relaxing nap on your :doughnut: this device will keep reporting
the water temperature, which you can check on your mobile at any time like a pro :tada:

Meanwhile it will also contribute to the network by executing tasks, earning shells for you :relaxed:

Do not check pool temperature yourself why bother ? Let this device do it for you :sparkles:
It will serve years, it will give you insights it will work and earn you shells, which you can - play with,
or leave for more of your sensors to burn them!

# :sweat_drops: So what is it?

A very simple hardware setup, made of ESP32 and Dallas temperature sensor that is water resistant.
A simple IP55 enclosure, one USB cable and nothing more. :+1:
Yes, we don't complicated things, simplicity only.

On top, GridShell installed ready to contribute and report telemetry data which you can consume on your phone or via web explorer.

We definitely suggest using the Widget on the phone, it does make life easier and looks more pro :muscle:

# :raised_hand: Whats cool about it ?

Glad you're asking, everything.
- The fact it is simple to build
- The fact you don't care about storing measurements, running servers.  
- The fact you join the grid
- The fact your sensor will submit tasks that other volunteers will execute and vice versa
- The fact you always know what your pool temp is
- The fact you contribute to the grid earning shells you can use
- The fact it is ready, download, upload and you're set.
