# Gridshell - Noiseblaster

A Gridshell enabled, headless noise sensor based on ESP32 and SKU_SEN0232 analog sensor.

Sound level meters are widely used in environmental noise detection, such as highway noise monitoring station, room noise monitoring and so on. 
Itâ€™s time for you to DIY a sound level detector to protect your hearing.

# What is it ?

Noise Blaster is a first real "demo" integration with the GridShell environment.
It is using DFRobot's sound meter to measure the sound levels and stores the output on the network.
This device is using solely Grid Shell to store, calculate and display data while still contributing with execution of tasks in the background.

It has a simple to 3D Print case (non waterproof!) for you to pack it up and start using.

# What is it made of ?

Noiseblaster is using two devices connected together with three wires.
This is all you need to measure noise levels in your surroundings.
