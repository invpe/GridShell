# üéä Example GridShell integrations

A compilation of sketches and gadgets currently utilizing GridShell for their operations. We anticipate this collection will expand over time. If you employ GridShell on your device, please feel free to contribute your solution. Likewise, if you've constructed any of the items in our repository, we'd love to hear from you!


# üå≤ LookO2 Air Quality Sensor 

https://github.com/invpe/LookO2

_LookO2 specializes in manufacturing high quality smog sensors. Both large metropolises and smaller cities are struggling with increasing air pollution, which negatively influences the health of people of all ages. The main feature of devices produced by LookO2 is simple and intuitive operation_ [üåê](https://looko2.com/)

We're integrating their sensors to GridShell network, bringing another #serverless solution to the place.
Hop in - check it out!

Oh ü§≠ btw, did i mention this sensor works on solar panels ? This makes it ZERO COST + 100% Eco when operating !

# :whale: Whale

https://github.com/invpe/GridShell/tree/main/Sources/Integrations/Whale

Another usefull integration with the GridShell network.
Measure temperature in your pool (or anywhere else) like a pro without hosting hassle.
Let your device contribute to the network by executing tasks and earning tokens meantime.
Use widget generated by the network to display temperature on your phone home screen.

Yes, you can run it from solar - zero cost again + 100% Eco !

# üå•Ô∏è Temperature and Humidity sensor

https://github.com/invpe/GridShell/tree/main/Sources/Integrations/BME280

At times, you might find yourself wanting to connect a couple of temperature sensors for various purposes, whether it's to monitor room temperature or experiment with available boards in your vicinity. Dive right in and transform them into fully integrated GridShell-connected sensors. In just a matter of minutes, you can set them up for deployment and leverage their JSON data output, which seamlessly integrates with GridShell's telemetry storage. You can either create a widget from the JSON data or seamlessly integrate them into your smart home system.

This simple gadget can run on solar power too, another one to build with zero cost for operating it  + 100% Eco!

# üåª Four Digits Display

https://github.com/invpe/GridShell/tree/main/Sources/Integrations/4DigitsDisplay

Occasionally, when we're feeling a bit bored, we seek something to tinker with. Here's an incredibly straightforward sketch that, when finished, will exhibit chosen statistics extracted from the GridShell API. If you happen to have a display of this nature on hand, investing just 10 minutes can brighten your day. Moreover, if you own a 3D printer, you can elevate the experience by creating an attractive casing for the device. In this sketch, we're not only showcasing data but also actively participating in the network by executing background tasks.

# ü™¥ Flora

https://github.com/invpe/GridShell/tree/main/Sources/Integrations/Flora

Monitoring plants soil moisture with GridShell.
In this example project, i will introduce you to the world of Bonsai, where the wisdom of nature's ancient guardians meets the innovation of modern technology. As first step - we will be monitoring the soil moisture levels of these venerable Bonsai trees, ensuring that their care aligns perfectly with their unique needs.
