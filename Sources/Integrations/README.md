Here is a list of projects that are using GridShell on daily basis, hopefully as the time flies 
we will see some of these products mature and go to market being operated totally on the network without in-between hostings.

A 100% green, eco friendly, zero carbon footprint, cost neutral noise sensors.

This is a flag product for the GridShell network. 
These devices run solely on the network being part of the Dedicated server but also Test Net Core tasks, 
they don't require any hosting or even web service - all things are happening with the use of shell tokens and on the people's nodes.
Nodes are powered by solar panels reducing costs to zero.
