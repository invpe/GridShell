# :seedling: Welcome

With billions of IOT devices connected today there is a huge potential of computing power ready for use at minimal or even zero cost. These tiny computers are capable of operating on renewable energies like solar power, giving tremendous opportunities for utilizing their computing capabilities without impacting environment. We all have WiFi enabled sensors, smart bulbs, sockets, plugs... which idle for most of their time - why not connect them together and use as one big computer to solve our problems ?

# :boom: Message from the author

I am excited to work on this project and have you visiting and joining the GridShell. 
As we stride forward in reshaping the landscape of ultra low power distributed computing, I want to acknowledge that this project is still in its development phase.
While we continue to innovate and refine our systems, it's only natural that you might encounter occasional hiccups or challenges along the way and i recognize that unforeseen issues might arise as we work to enhance the platform's capabilities.

During this development phase, all feedback is invaluable to me. 
If you encounter any issues, have suggestions, or experience any uncertainties feel free to reach out to me - because, as the old adage goes, there's nothing quite like the synergy that arises when two minds come together to innovate and solve challenges.

GridShell is being developed ~~few months~~ a year now by single me, ironing out issues, optimizing the platform, creating a seamless experience, building the logic behind.
With your support and understanding, I am confident that this hobby project will continue to evolve into something much bigger than i initially thought.
