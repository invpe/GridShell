# :seedling: Welcome

With billions of IOT devices connected today there is a huge potential of computing power ready for use at minimal or even zero cost. These tiny computers are capable of operating on renewable energies like solar power, giving tremendous opportunities for utilizing their computing capabilities without impacting environment. We all have WiFi enabled sensors, smart bulbs, sockets, plugs... which idle for most of their time - why not connect them together and use as one big computer to solve our problems ?

The project started mid june 2022 as a coding-challenge, 
it is now `VER0.05` and running a `TestNet` which means everyone can 
join, contribute and use the network. 
GridShell is made to be used by everyone. 
Once you connect your nodes will be granted Shells for each 
task execution. You will be able to use these Shells to write telemetry and 
execute your own tasks on the GridShell network.


# :sparkles: How does it work 

Please see documentation for more detailed explanation. In simple words, it works as follows:

- People join the network with their ESP32 devices (nodes)
- Network executes tasks (written in [MyBasic](https://github.com/paladin-t/my_basic)) on volunteer nodes
- Each volunteer is granted a "Shell" (after validation) for a proper execution
- Shells are used to submit a tasks and use the network

The more nodes connected, the more computing power the network has.
Since version `0.05` everyone can submit a task and start using available resources :+1:

All tasks are written with MyBasic, this allows to simplify 
integration / adoption even more.

# :boom: Important

This is a very dynamic project where i often do changes, ensure to keep up with the latest and greatest versions of the sources.
The project has nothing to do with mining, crypto or things like that so don't approach it that way. As of today it is in early shapes
being developed ~~few months~~ a year now by single me, so don't expect things to work like a charm everytime here ;-)
Also,
I try to document all major changes in `Gridshell Improvement Proposal` documents that are stored in the [Documentation](https://github.com/invpe/gridshell/tree/main/Documentation) directory.

# :running: Where do i go next

- Join the network with this [link](https://github.com/invpe/GridShell/tree/main/Documentation/Tutorials)
- Checkout ready to use integrations like [NoiseBlaster](https://github.com/invpe/GridShell/tree/main/Sources/Integrations/NoiseBlaster)
- Checkout the GTN (Grid Test Net) status [link](https://api.gridshell.net/status/)
- Checkout the sources [link](https://github.com/invpe/GridShell/tree/main/Sources)
