# üî† Library of tasks

This is a library of tasks created for executing on the network.

With community contributions, we hope to expand this list of versatile tasks that can be easily utilized by anyone, eventually creating a comprehensive resource for a wide range of purposes.

GridShell encourages contributions in all areas, but scripts are the essential components that drive its functionality. You are encouraged to submit your solutions here, and they will be thoroughly tested. Once your contributions have been successfully validated, they will be published, and you will receive due credit for your efforts.

Use [Playground](https://github.com/invpe/GridShell/tree/main/Sources/Playground) a simple web application to write and test scripts.
